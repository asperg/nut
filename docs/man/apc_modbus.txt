apc_modbus - Driver for APC Smart-UPS Modbus protocol

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

Generally this driver should work for all the APC Modbus UPS devices. Some
devices might expose more than is currently supported, like multiple phases.

Tested with the following hardware:

 - SMT1500 (Smart-UPS 1500, Firmware 9.6)
 - SMX750  (Smart-UPS X 750, Firmware 10.1)
 - SMX1500 (Smart-UPS X 1500, Firmware 15.0)

Note that you will have to enable Modbus communication. In the front panel of
the UPS, go to Advanced Menu mode, under Configuration and enable Modbus.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver also supports the following optional settings:

include::nut_usb_addvars.txt[]

*porttype*='value'::
Set the type of the port used. Available values are serial for RS232/485 based
connections, tcp for TCP/IP connections and usb for USB connections.

*port*='value'::
Depending on the port type you can select a port here. For usb only auto is
supported, for serial you can pass a device path like /dev/ttyS0 and for tcp you
can pass a hostname with optional port like example.com:502.

*baudrate*='num'::
Set the speed of the serial connection. The default baudrate is 9600.

*parity*='value'::
Set the parity of the serial connection. Available values are N for none, E for
even and O for odd. The default parity is N (none).

*databits*='num'::
Set the data bits of the serial connection. The default databits is 8.

*stopbits*='num'::
Set the stop bits of the serial connection. The default stopbits is 1.

*slaveid*='num'::
Set the Modbus slave id. The default slave id is 1.

*response_timeout_ms*='num'::
Set the Modbus response timeout. The default timeout is set by libmodbus. It can
be good to set a higher timeout on TCP connections with high latency.
